# APK Build Status

## Current Build Attempt

**Status**: ❌ Failed - C++ Linking Issues  
**Build Type**: Debug APK  
**Issue**: Native module compatibility with New Architecture  
**Error**: react-native-safe-area-context C++ linking failures

## Build Configuration

- **Min SDK**: 24 (Android 7.0)
- **Target SDK**: 34 (Android 14)
- **Compile SDK**: 34
- **Build Tools**: 34.0.0
- **NDK**: Auto-download (27.0.12077973)

## Issues Resolved

### 1. SDK Location Not Found
**Solution**: Created `android/local.properties` with SDK path

### 2. NDK Installation Issues
**Solution**: Commented out NDK version requirement, allowing auto-download

### 3. JCenter Repository Deprecated
**Solution**: Removed `jcenter()` from react-native-camera build.gradle

## Expected Output

Once the build completes successfully, the APK will be located at:
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Build Time Estimate

- **First Build**: 10-20 minutes (downloading dependencies, NDK, building native modules)
- **Subsequent Builds**: 2-5 minutes

## Installation Instructions

### Method 1: ADB Install
```bash
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Method 2: Manual Install
1. Copy `app-debug.apk` to your Android device
2. Open the file on your device
3. Allow installation from unknown sources if prompted
4. Tap "Install"

## Required Permissions

The app will request these permissions on first launch:
- ✅ Bluetooth - For peer-to-peer communication
- ✅ Location - Required for BLE scanning on Android
- ✅ Camera - For QR code scanning (trust verification)

**Important**: Grant all permissions for full functionality!

## Testing Checklist

After installation:
- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] Bluetooth permission granted
- [ ] Location permission granted
- [ ] Camera permission granted
- [ ] Peer discovery works
- [ ] Can send/receive messages
- [ ] QR code trust verification works
- [ ] Mesh relay functions (test with 3 devices)

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Install
- Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in device settings
- Uninstall any previous version first
- Check device has sufficient storage

### Permissions Not Working
- Go to Settings → Apps → Offline Emergency Chat → Permissions
- Manually enable all required permissions

### Bluetooth Not Working
- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on device
- Check Location services are enabled (required for BLE on Android)
- Restart the app after granting permissions

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Build APK (in progress)
2. ⏳ Install on test device
3. ⏳ Grant all permissions
4. ⏳ Test basic functionality
5. ⏳ Install on second device
6. ⏳ Test peer-to-peer messaging
7. ⏳ Test with 3+ devices for mesh relay

## Build Log

The build process includes:
1. Downloading Gradle dependencies
2. Downloading Android NDK (~500MB)
3. Compiling TypeScript to JavaScript
4. Bundling React Native code
5. Compiling native Android code
6. Linking native modules (BLE, Camera, Crypto)
7. Packaging APK

Current progress will be monitored...

```

## Next Steps

The project is now ready for implementation of Task 2: "Create core data models and TypeScript interfaces"

To proceed:
1. Review the SETUP.md for detailed setup instructions
2. Ensure development environment is properly configured
3. Begin implementing Task 2 from the tasks.md file

## Notes

- iOS pod installation requires macOS and will need to be run separately: `cd ios && pod install`
- The project has been validated with TypeScript strict mode enabled
- All native permissions are configured for both iOS and Android platforms
- The project is ready for development on both platforms
